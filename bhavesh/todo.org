** do-run
   forces a function which returns a lazy-sequence to execute till the end without waiting.
*** doc :
(dorun coll) (dorun n coll)

When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side
effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first
element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. dorun can
be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of
the seq, does not retain the head and returns nil.

user=> (dorun 5 (repeatedly #(println "hi")))
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi
nil
** incidental complexity.
  complexity faced while developing code in a particular language after the problem has been solved logically. Clojure has very less incidental complexity.
